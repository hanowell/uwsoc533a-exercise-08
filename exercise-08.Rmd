# Introduction {.unnumbered}

**In this assignment, I will:**

1. **Walk you through the projection of a two-sex closed population assuming constant age-specific fertility and mortality rates**
1. **Ask you some questions along the way**
1. **Including some questions about the assumptions of the open one-sex population projection model we studied in class**

**This assignment will prepare you for the portion of the final where you will conduct a population project across multiple projection intervals on your own.**

**I know this sounds CRAZY but... you will not have to construct any life tables this week.**

# Data collection {.unnumbered}

# About the data {.unnumbered}

You've just loaded the following data from Chile in 1992:

* **`CHLasfrRR` gives the annual period age-specific fertility rate (`ASFR`) by five-year age groups for Chile in 1992**
* **`mltper_5x1` gives the annual period life table for males in five-year age groups with the typical columns we've seen in previous weeks**
* **`fltper_5x1` is the corresponding life table for females**
